🌾 Crop Recommendation System using Machine Learning!
This Crop Recommendation System is developed using a Kaggle dataset that contains soil and climatic parameters such as Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall. 
Machine learning techniques are applied to analyze these features and recommend the most suitable crop for cultivation, helping improve agricultural productivity and decision-making.
